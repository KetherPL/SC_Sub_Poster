# SC Sub Poster (Steam Client Library)

A Rust library that provides a wrapper around the `steam-vent` crate for logging in to Steam and operating on the Steam Group Chats.

Actually all we need just to post `!sub` requests on our Steam Group Chat ;)

## Dependencies

This library depends on:
- `steam-vent` - Steam network interaction
- `tokio` - Async runtime
- `tracing` - Logging
- `serde` - Serialization
